## 🚀 Features

- Clean and modular pipeline in Python
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Model comparison using MAE, RMSE, R²
- Bonus: Streamlit interface for salary prediction demo (optional)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- Optional: Streamlit for web-based deployment

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Structured CSV with columns such as:
  - `Education_Level`
  - `Years_of_Experience`
  - `Job_Role`
  - `Location`
  - `Current_Salary`

> Replace this with the actual dataset link or description if available.
